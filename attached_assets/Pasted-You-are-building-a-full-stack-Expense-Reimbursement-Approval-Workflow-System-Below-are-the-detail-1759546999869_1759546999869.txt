You are building a full-stack Expense Reimbursement & Approval Workflow System.
Below are the detailed requirements — please generate production-quality code with clean architecture, authentication, APIs, and frontend.

📌 Problem Statement

Companies struggle with manual expense reimbursement processes that are:

Time-consuming

Error-prone

Non-transparent

We need a system that supports:

Defining approval flows based on thresholds.

Managing multi-level approvals.

Supporting flexible and hybrid approval rules.

📌 Core Features
1. Authentication & User Management

On first signup/login:

A new Company is auto-created.

Default currency is set from the company’s country (use RestCountries API).

An Admin User is auto-created.

Admin can:

Create Employees & Managers.

Assign or change roles (Employee, Manager, Admin).

Define reporting relationships (Employee → Manager).

Configure approval rules (sequences, conditional logic).

2. Expense Submission (Employee Role)

Employees can submit expense claims with:

Amount (any currency → convert to company currency via ExchangeRate API).

Category, Description, Date.

Receipt upload with OCR (auto-read details: amount, date, vendor, expense type).

Employees can view their own history (Approved, Pending, Rejected).

3. Approval Workflow (Manager/Admin Role)

Expenses follow a step-by-step approval chain.

Admin defines sequence of approvers.

Example: Step 1 → Manager → Step 2 → Finance → Step 3 → Director.

Rules:

Expense moves to next approver only after current one approves/rejects.

If “Is Manager Approver” is enabled, first approval goes to direct manager.

Managers/Admins can:

View pending approvals.

Approve/Reject with comments.

View approval history for audit.

4. Conditional Approval Rules

Percentage Rule: e.g., If 60% approvers approve → Approved.

Specific Approver Rule: e.g., If CFO approves → Auto-approved.

Hybrid Rule: e.g., 60% OR CFO approval → Approved.

Can combine sequential flow + conditional rules.

📌 Role Permissions

Admin: Create company (auto on signup), manage users/roles, configure approval rules, view all expenses, override approvals.

Manager: Approve/reject expenses (amount visible in company’s default currency), view team expenses, escalate as per rules.

Employee: Submit expenses, view their own submissions, track approval status.

📌 Additional Features

OCR for receipts (auto-generate expense details).

Multi-currency support (conversion API).

Audit trail (log all actions).

📌 APIs

Country & Currency:
https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all?fields=name,currencies

Currency Conversion:
https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/{BASE_CURRENCY}

📌 Mockup

Wireframe: Excalidraw

👉 Please generate a full-stack application with:

Backend: Node.js/Express (or Flask/FastAPI if Python), REST APIs, database schema (PostgreSQL or MongoDB).

Frontend: React with Tailwind, clean UI for roles (Admin, Manager, Employee).

Auth: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control.

OCR: Integrate Tesseract.js or similar.

Currency Conversion: Use ExchangeRate API on submission.

Deployment: Docker setup with instructions.

⚡ Final Output Expected:

Clean modular code (backend + frontend).

Database schema + migrations.

API endpoints documented.

Role-based dashboards.

Example data seeding script.
